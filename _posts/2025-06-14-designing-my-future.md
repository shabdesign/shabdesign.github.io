I created this website as a manifestation of my enthusiasm for entering the world of UI/UX design. Although I began learning the basics last year, most of it was purely theoretical—I had barely touched Figma. I had explored several types of art and design before, but something always felt missing. That made it hard for me to stay motivated or take any bold steps.

A few months ago, I decided to shift direction. UI/UX design came back to mind, and the more I explored, the more captivated I became. At the end of May, I began studying UI/UX more intensively, and I finally felt excited. Starting in June, I’ve been working on personal projects and updating them here on this website. I hope that in the coming months, I can continue developing my skills and be ready to take on meaningful jobs and projects.

The logo of this website illustrates the relationship of “communication that becomes design that becomes a communication tool”—a flow that I find truly fascinating about UI/UX. This idea is what excites me the most.The logo itself isn’t perfect—I made it in a bit of a rush—but I wanted to display it anyway, as a reminder of my enthusiasm at the beginning of this learning journey. Maybe I’ll improve or change it in the future, but for now, it holds meaning.
