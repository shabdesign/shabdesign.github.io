I just created my very first UI/UX design, and it’s been a long time since I last went through a complete design process after taking a break. I was so excited—maybe too excited—that I rushed into things without taking the time to explore ideas properly. I built the wireframe in just three hours, and completed the prototype in three days. But as I neared the finish line, I realized that my design didn’t align with its original purpose. The visual style felt outdated and didn’t reflect the direction I was aiming for.

After reflecting for a while, I decided to go back to square one and start again from the wireframe. This time, I gave myself one full day to explore ideas, another day to sketch rough concepts on paper, and one more day to refine the wireframe in Figma. I then spent a full week building the prototype.

Looking back, I’m grateful that I took a step—or two—back. This version of the design feels much more aligned with its purpose, and I’m quite happy with how it turned out. I conducted a round of validation yesterday and received several positive responses, although there’s still plenty of room for improvement.Still, it’s far better than pushing forward with a design that completely missed its goal.
