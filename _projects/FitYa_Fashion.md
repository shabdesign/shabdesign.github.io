## Background
<div style="text-align: justify;">
  Online clothing shopping has become part of the modern lifestyle, particularly among fashion enthusiasts. However, although practical, this process is often accompanied by uncertainty: "Will the clothes I buy fit my body?"
Many online shoppers, including me, also experience similar problems. Some of the clothes I bought could not be worn because they did not match the size and fit expectations. This causes disappointment, discomfort, and even loss because not all items can be exchanged.
On the other hand, buyers who want to place custom orders often experience difficulties because they can generally only be done via private chat, which is prone to miscommunication and inefficiency. This is also a problem for tailors and home fashion entrepreneurs who often receive custom orders.
The initial inspiration for this project came from a scene in a drama, where VIP customers do not need to try on clothes one by one, because a model with a similar body has been provided to demonstrate the clothes they are interested in. This idea highlights the value of a personally relevant visual experience and the ability to choose the right fit in the clothing selection process.

## User Survey Overview
<div style="text-align: justify;">
To better understand user pain points and expectations regarding online fashion shopping and custom tailoring, a survey was conducted, yielding 119 valid responses. The findings reveal significant issues in sizing accuracy, communication, and order transparency — all of which directly inform the development of features in FitYa. </div>
These are the key insights found:

### Sizing issues are highly common in online shopping
- 96.36% of respondents have experienced receiving clothes that didn’t fit.
- 47.90% leave the item unused, while only 21.85% attempt returns.
- Main causes: unclear product descriptions and misleading photos.

### Miscommunication is the biggest pain point in custom orders
- Many users report that custom pieces often don’t match the agreed-upon design.
- Issues like incomplete fabric or design errors cause delays and dissatisfaction.

### Lack of transparency in order progress causes uncertainty
- Time estimates and updates are often unclear, especially in custom orders.
- This leads to user anxiety and loss of trust in the tailoring process.

### Users are excited about personalized shopping solutions
- 93.27% are interested in using FitYa’s custom tailoring and virtual fitting features.
- Most users consider size recommendations and visual references to be the most helpful tools.
- A small percentage expressed concern about data privacy, especially regarding body measurements.

## Key Solutions
