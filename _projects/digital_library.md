## Background
Digital platforms are a primary need for students in their learning activities. Academic books and articles need to be accessible anytime, anywhere. Physical book lending systems should also be manageable online. While some universities have introduced digital libraries, most of them still have poor usability and outdated interface. As a result, many students are unaware of or do not fully understand the benefits of digital libraries. According to the Higher Education Database (PDDikti), there were 9.32 million active students in Indonesia in 2025, yet only around 1.5 million have used their campus digital library. This indicates a gap between the demand for and the use of digital technology in academic environments.

## Objectives

- **Identify usability issues** — Evaluate interface pain points from user interviews and heuristic analysis.
- **Understand student behavior** — Analyze how students currently interact with digital library tools.
- **Design improved UI** — Create wireframes and UI concepts focused on accessibility and simplicity.
- **Prototype & test** — Validate design through usability testing and iteration.

This is my **first solo project**. I took on the whole role **from research planningto interface design**.
