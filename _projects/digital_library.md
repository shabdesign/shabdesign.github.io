## Background
<div class="justify">
Digital platforms are a primary need for students in their learning activities. Academic books and articles need to be accessible anytime, anywhere. Physical book lending systems should also be manageable online. **While some universities have introduced digital libraries, most of them still have poor usability and outdated interface.** As a result, many students are unaware of or do not fully understand the benefits of digital libraries. According to the Higher Education Database (PDDikti), there were 9.32 million active students in Indonesia in 2025, yet only around 1.5 million have used their campus digital library. **This indicates a gap between the demand for and the use of digital technology, especially digital library, in academic environments.**

## Objectives

- **Identify usability issues** — Evaluate interface pain points from user interviews and heuristic analysis.
- **Understand student behavior** — Analyze how students currently interact with digital library tools.
- **Design improved UI** — Create wireframes and UI concepts focused on accessibility and simplicity.
- **Prototype & test** — Validate design through usability testing and iteration.

## My Role
This is my **first solo project**. I took on the whole role **from research planningto interface design**.

## Research Methods
<div class="justify">
This project employs a **mixed-method approach** that combines **quantitative user research (survey) and dessk research (competitive analysis)**  to explore and improve the user experience of campus digital library platforms in Indonesia.
</div>
### User Research (Survey)
<div class="justify">
A quantitative survey was conducted to gather insights from Indonesian university students who have used campus digital libraries. It explored user demographics, behavior, perceptions, and expectations. **The survey was distributed online via social media using convenience sampling with a minimum target of 164 respondents (Slovin, confidence level 80%, margin of error 5%)**.
</div>
### Desk Research (Competitive analysis)
<div class="justify">
To complement the user insights, a comparative review of four selected university digital library platforms was conducted: **BINUS University, Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia (UPI), Universitas Indonesia (UI), and Universitas Terbuka (UT)**. These platforms were selected based on a combination of user representation in the survey and their prominence in digital library implementation.
The competitive analysis focused on key UX and UI elements such as **Accessibility and login system, Search functionality, Type and format of collections, Mobile responsiveness, Supporting features (e.q., personalization, download options, citation tools), and Integration with other academic services**. This comparison provided additional context on usability patterns and feature gaps across campuses.
