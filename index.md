## Introduction

Hi, I’m Shabrina — a self-taught learner currently exploring the world of UX Research & Design since 2023. I’ve been learning through e-learning platforms and bootcamp programs at MySkill, where I developed a strong interest in designing thoughtful, user-centered solutions.

Before diving into UX, I studied Landscape Architecture (unfinished) and worked as a freelance graphic designer from 2022 to 2024. My visual background helps me blend aesthetics with functionality in design.

In addition to creative work, I was actively involved in a student organization at my faculty, serving as a member (2021) and later secretary (2022) of the Business & Partnership division in the Student Executive Board (BEM A IPB). This experience helped sharpen my teamwork, communication, and organizational skills—all of which support my growth in UX.

Originally from Bandung, I’m now based in South Tangerang, Indonesia.

Always eager to learn, collaborate, and design meaningful digital experiences.
