Besides being a place to showcase my UI design portfolio, I also built this website to help me understand a bit more about web development. I’ve been trying to learn how the different parts of this site work by teaching myself and following some online courses on web development basics. But to be honest—it’s been difficult and confusing.

Even this simple website has broken a few times along the way. And during the lessons, I often found myself overwhelmed by all the new languages and unfamiliar terms.

Still, I’m not giving up. Let’s keep going—and become a web designer who actually understands how the web works!
